How to design an OS from first principles

A lot of operating system development guides stress the ***SUPER INTENSE*** and *scarryyyy* difficulty of writing your own OS. But here we like to keep things fun and friendly. Want to write something you could *technically* call an OS in 100 lines of code and call it done? Sure! IDGAF.

## Need to know

- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Programming best practices
- Assembly
- C/C++
- Linux
- Toolchains
- Emulators and VMs
- Executables
- Target platform
  - Instruction Set
  - Chipset
  - Privledge levels
  - Memory
  - *Registers*

## Descision Tree

- Target Platform (START HERE)
- Supported Toolchain (OR HERE)
- Initial toolchain
  - This is a very important step, but is mostly important for implementation, less so for design/planning.
